# How to create a custom DocumentManager with a custom View and a custom Document


This example illustrates how to create a custom <strong>DocumentManager</strong>. Once you place this component onto a form, it is possible to convert the current View to <strong>WidgetView</strong> by using this component's smart tag. In this case, a custom <strong>WidgetView</strong> will be created. When you create new documents at design time or runtime, custom documents will be created. For demonstration purposes, we added a new custom property to the custom Document class.Â
